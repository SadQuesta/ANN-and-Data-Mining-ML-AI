# 📊 Evaluating Healthcare Systems and Policies to Increase Life Expectancy

This project was presented as part of the **Data Mining Course Project Exhibition** at Istanbul Nişantaşı University in May 2024.  
It explores **how healthcare systems influence life expectancy** using both regression and clustering methods.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze healthcare indicators across six countries
- Identify key variables affecting life expectancy
- Provide **data-driven policy recommendations**
- Use regression and clustering techniques for insights

---

## 📚 Methods & Tools

### 🔹 1. Linear Regression
- **Goal**: Predict healthy life span based on indicators like:
  - Health expenditure
  - Number of doctors per 1000 people
  - Number of hospitals
  - Healthcare satisfaction score
- **Model Performance**: R² and MSE used to evaluate accuracy
- **Findings**:  
  - Satisfaction level and doctor ratio significantly impact life expectancy  
  - High spending ≠ high lifespan → *Efficiency > Quantity*

### 🔹 2. K-Means Clustering
- **Goal**: Group countries into health-performance-based clusters
- **Steps**:
  - Data normalization
  - Elbow method for optimal K
  - K-Means to classify countries
- **Outcome**:  
  - Identified clusters representing different healthcare efficiency levels  
  - Supported customized policy development

## 🌍 Countries Analyzed

- 🇹🇷 Turkey  
- 🇸🇪 Sweden  
- 🇮🇹 Italy  
- 🇧🇪 Belgium  
- 🇫🇷 France  
- 🇱🇻 Latvia

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Belgium & Sweden achieve **high lifespan with low investment** → efficient systems  
- Turkey & Latvia need **better resource distribution**, not just more funding  
- Patient satisfaction & doctor availability matter more than hospital count

---

## 📌 Policy Recommendations

- ✅ **Efficient Fund Allocation** over excessive spending  
- ✅ **Focus on Patient Satisfaction** and healthcare quality  
- ✅ **Preventive Care Investment** and early diagnosis  
- ✅ **Balanced Infrastructure Growth** – hospitals + medical staff  
- ✅ **Healthcare Workforce Incentives** – attract more doctors  
- ✅ **Tailored Strategies** for each country's unique needs

## 🧠 Final Thought

> "More money doesn't buy more health. Efficient systems, satisfied patients, and preventive care do."
